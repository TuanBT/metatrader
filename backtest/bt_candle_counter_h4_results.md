*Generated: 2026-02-24 (manual)*
**XAUUSDm H4 | Lot=0.01 | No time/ATR filter**

| Config | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | All+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H4 NoFilter  | -36.0% (338d) | -34.1% (382d) | **+32.8%** (362d) | **+167.2%** (392d) | ⚠ |
| H4 EMA50     | -18.8% (250d) | -8.7%  (270d) | **+25.0%** (284d) | (cached)           | ⚠ |

## Notes
- WR across all configs = 50% (no directional edge in the pattern itself)
- 2022/2023 = consistently negative → H4 gains in 2024/2025 are trend-regime dependent (XAUUSD bull run)
- EMA50 filter reduces losses in bad years but doesn't turn them profitable
- No config passes 4-year robustness test
